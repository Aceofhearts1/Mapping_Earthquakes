# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Some tools used:
- D3
- GeoJSON
- Javascript
- Html
- CSS
- Leaflet
- Mapbox API

## Goal
The goal here was to use earthquake JSON data and then turn it into a visualization. Mapbox API came in handy for the map background. Leaflet allowed us to make the map interactive and present some data with the use of markers.

## The results:
